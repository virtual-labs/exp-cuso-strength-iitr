**(I) Standardization of Na₂S₂O₃ (Hypo)**

1. Take a clean and dry conical flask.  
2. Pipette out 10 ml CuSO₄ into a clean, dry conical flask.  
3. Add 5 ml of KI solution; a dark yellowish-brown color appears.  
4. Titrate this solution against hypo until it becomes light yellow.  
5. Add 1–2 drops of starch indicator (blue color appears).  
6. Continue titration until the color changes to milky white (endpoint).  
7. Repeat the titration to obtain concordant readings.

**(II) Titration of Unknown CuSO₄ Solution**

Repeat the above steps using the unknown CuSO₄ sample in place of the known solution.

#### **Safety Precautions**

1. Use distilled water throughout the experiment.  
2. Use the same volume of starch indicator in each titration.  
3. Prepare the starch indicator freshly.  
4. Observe the endpoint carefully.


#### **Clean-Up**

1. Dispose of waste solutions properly.  
2. Clean and return all glassware to its designated place.
